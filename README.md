# Tic-Tac-Toe
🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game
A classic Tic Tac Toe (Noughts and Crosses) game built using modern web technologies. Play with a friend in a simple, interactive 3x3 grid-based game.

🛠️ I built this project as a fun way to develop my frontend and logical thinking skills, and to practice working with user interaction and game logic.

🧠 Game Rules
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

Player 1 is X, Player 2 is O.

Players take turns placing their marks.

The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.

If all 9 squares are filled and there’s no winner, the game ends in a draw.

🚀 Features
